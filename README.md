# TibHCR dataset

This is a dataset link for the paper "TibHCR: A Large-Scale Dataset for Offline Handwritten Tibetan Character Recognition".

## Explanations
Detailed explanations can be found in the [file](https://github.com/qixiaoke007/TibHCR/blob/main/Explanations.pdf) for several questions raised in the paper, which are listed below.
1) There is a lack of explanation about the classes of characters to be collected. What is the reason for deciding on 47 classes?
2) Is it appropriate to collect characters written within a square frame?
3) Are the positions and sizes of the characters that make up syllables appropriate?
